Changelog:
----------

2012-01-10 v0.2: Skye Nott
                 - Renamed lang/en.php to lang/english.php
                 - Changed default to check IP and email (those seem to get the best result)
                 - Added new "force_generic" option to show less helpful message. I do not want
                   spammers to get any hint as to why they are being blocked (eg many spammers have a pool of IPs to use)
                 - Added new "freq_min" option for finer control over blocking threshold. All checked fields frequency is
                   added, if it is above this score it's considered spammy. Use value 1 for maximum blocking (like v0.1)
                 - Fixed duplicate "check_email" URL arg which was supposed to be check_username

2011-11-28 v0.1: Thomas Seifert
